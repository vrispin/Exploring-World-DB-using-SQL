# Exploring-World-DB-using-SQL
In this project, I explored SQL using the "world" database, covering countries, cities, and populations. I practiced from basic SELECT queries to complex JOIN operations, enhancing my understanding of SQL for managing relational databases. This hands-on experience with real-world data honed my SQL skills and provided valuable insights.
